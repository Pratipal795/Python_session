Iterate 0 to 10 using for loop, do the same using while loop.

Iterate 10 to 0 using for loop, do the same using while loop.

Write a loop that makes seven calls to print(), so we get on the output the following triangle:

  #
  ##
  ###
  ####
  #####
  ######
  #######
Use nested loops to create the following:

# # # # # # # #
# # # # # # # #
# # # # # # # #
# # # # # # # #
# # # # # # # #

Print the following pattern:

0 x 0 = 0
1 x 1 = 1
2 x 2 = 4
3 x 3 = 9
4 x 4 = 16
5 x 5 = 25
6 x 6 = 36
7 x 7 = 49
8 x 8 = 64
9 x 9 = 81
10 x 10 = 100
Iterate through the list, ['Python', 'Numpy','Pandas','Django', 'Flask'] using a for loop and print out the items.

Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print only even numbers

Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print only odd numbers

Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print the sum of all numbers.

The sum of all numbers is 5050.
Declare a function named reverse_list. It takes an array as a parameter and it returns the reverse of the array (use loops).

print(reverse_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
# [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
print(reverse_list1(["A", "B", "C"]))
# ["C", "B", "A"]
Declare a function named capitalize_list_items. It takes a list as a parameter and it returns a capitalized list of items
Declare a function named add_item. It takes a list and an item parameters. It returns a list with the item added at the end.
food_staff = ['Potato', 'Tomato', 'Mango', 'Milk'];
print(  add_item(food_staff, 'Meat'))     # ['Potato', 'Tomato', 'Mango', 'Milk','Meat'];
numbers = [2, 3, 7, 9];
print(add_item(numbers, 5))      [2, 3, 7, 9, 5]
Declare a function named remove_item. It takes a list and an item parameters. It returns a list with the item removed from it.
food_staff = ['Potato', 'Tomato', 'Mango', 'Milk'];
print(remove_item(food_staff, 'Mango'))  # ['Potato', 'Tomato', 'Milk'];
numbers = [2, 3, 7, 9];
print(remove_item(numbers, 3))  # [2, 7, 9]
Declare a function named sum_of_numbers. It takes a number parameter and it adds all the numbers in that range.
print(sum_of_numbers(5))  # 15
print(sum_all_numbers(10)) # 55
print(sum_all_numbers(100)) # 5050
Declare a function named sum_of_odds. It takes a number parameter and it adds all the odd numbers in that range.

Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print the sum of all evens and the sum of all odds.

The sum of all evens is 2550. And the sum of all odds is 2500.
Go to the data folder and use the countries.py file. Loop through the countries and extract all the countries containing the word land.

This is a fruit list, ['banana', 'orange', 'mango', 'lemon'] reverse the order using loop.
